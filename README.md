# Happy-Habits-Code

This is an app that is aimed to help individuals build good habits and release bad habits. This app is used as a tracker to keep track of day-to-day progress on personal habits. If you want to see how you have grown, check out your progress in the streaks feature. Not everyone has the same habits, so the user can add his/her own custom habits to make sure the app is personalized for him/her. Furthermore, these custom habits can be added to the userâ€™s personal  Google Calendar to provide daily reminders of this habit.
